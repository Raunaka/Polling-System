## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package installed in your environement and mongodb for database.

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

```
$ node --version

$ npm --version

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

```
$ npm install npm -g
